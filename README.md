# Triangle-Tracker

Building an application that will help us know whether a triangle is isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NOT a triangle at all.
Getting Started
Based on the functionality of the application, key points to note are:

For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.
For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
Most importantly, if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values. (For example, the values 9,4 & 3 cannot form a triangle).

As a user, I want to enter the length values of the three sides of my triangle in the application.
After submitting my values, the application should tell me what type of triangle my values will produce, whether an isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NO triangle at all.

OBJECTIVES

The project will be evaluated based on the following objectives:

The project uses one or more javascript functions.
Appropriate control flows and logical operators are used in the project.
The project makes use of one or more arrays in javascript.
The project uses a  HTML input to collect user data.
The project uses a custom CSS stylesheet that incorporates cascading, box model and floats.
The project works as expected, achieving the functionality required.
The project demonstrates an understanding of the week's concepts. If requested, you should be able to explain your code to your instructor.
